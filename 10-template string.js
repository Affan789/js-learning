// template string
let name = "affan";
let age = 18;
let aboutMe = "my name is " + name + " and my age is " + age;
console.log(aboutMe);
// as you can see this method is very long but another way to do this is by using the template string method
aboutMe = `my name is ${name} and my age is ${age} `;
console.log(aboutMe);
