// in this program i have made a function in an object and the function calls the name,age and gender of the person
// and i have added 'this' keyword in the template string 
// so the this keyword includes the whole object and then calls the name age and gender otherwise if i didnt added this keyword
// then it would have given us an error the 'this' is being referred to as the whole object so that it calls the name age and gender from the object

// now i am gonna make a program in which i am going to make call different peoples Info using this method
